# Checkers-AI

Play a game of Checkers (Draughts) against an AI!


You can choose how difficult you would like the AI to be, but I recommend a level of 4 or 5. The higher the level, the harder the AI.

## Requirements

Try these commands. If none of them work, watch one of the videos linked on how to fix your pip.
```bash
pip install pygame
```

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

```bash
python -m pip install pygame
```

```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Download everything and run the main.py file.
```bash
cd Downloads/Checkers-AI
python main.py
```

If `python main.py` doesn't work, try `python3 main.py`.

Or, you can run it in Gitpod
